# Fake news detection system

### <b> Description of the Project </b>

This project mainly focuses on detecting whether the text news is fake or real. 

### <b> Flow of the project </b>

* First of all the text data is cleaned properly using different concepts such as <b> Normalizing Text </b>,<b> Removing stopwords </b>.

* Some <b> Text vectorization</b> is done using <b> TfidfVectorizer</b>.

* Then fake news is detected using <b>Linear Regression Model</b> and <b>Decision Tree</b>. The accuracy of both the algorithm was almost the same.
